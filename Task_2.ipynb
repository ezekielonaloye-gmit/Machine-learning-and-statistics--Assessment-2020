    "The Chi-square test is a non-parametric method used to compare or determine whether a relationship exists between categorical variables in a contingency table [1].The chi-square test of independence tests for dependence between categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence is a crucial concept in probability that describes a situation where knowing the value of one variable tells you something about another's value.  For instance, our birth month doesn't indicate which web browser we use, indicating our birth month and browser preference to be independent. On the other hand, the month of birth might correlate to the month and age pupils gain admission into primary school, so the month of birth and school admission might not be independent[3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test of independence tests whether two categorical variables are independent. The independence test determines whether variables like education, political views, and other preferences vary based on demographic factors like gender, race, and religion [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the significance of the test is below 0.05, the variables have a significant dependence. For this task, a scipy.stats  package was used to conduct a test of independence. I used stats.chi2_contingency() function to run a test of independence automatically given a frequency table of observed counts. "
