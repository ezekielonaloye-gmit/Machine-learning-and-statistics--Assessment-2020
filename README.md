All exercises are compabitible with Python 3 upwards. 


## Summary of Tasks 
<dl>
  
  <dt>Task_1.ipynb</dt>
  <dd>Python function called <em>sqrt2</em> not depending on any module from the standard library, or otherwise, that calculates and points to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.</dd>

  <dt>Task_2.ipynb</dt>
  <dd>The Chi-squared test for independence to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent.</dd>
 
 <dt>Task_3.ipynb</dt>
  <dd>Research and comparison of STDEV.S and STDEV.P using numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.</dd>

  <dt>Task_4.ipynb</dt>
  <dd>Use of Scikit-learn to apply k Nearest Neighbours clustering to Fisher's famous Irish Data Set with explanation of code and model to make predictions. </dd>
