    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Standard Deviation was introduced by Karl Pearson in 1893.The standard deviation is a measure of how widely values are dispersed from the average value (the mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a dataset(set of numeric values).The variance is often used to quantify spread or dispersion. Spread is a characteristic of a sample or population that describes how much variability there is in it [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "A high variance tells us that the values in our dataset are far from their mean which imply high levels of variability. On the other hand, a low variance tells us that the values are quite close to the mean. In this case, the data will have low levels of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft excel calculates standard deviation for two different scenarios, one for Standard Deviation for (Sample) and Standard Deviation for (Population) using two different function known as STDEV.P for population and STDEV.S for sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "STDEV.P for population: STDEV.P(number1,[number2],...)\n",
    "\n",
    "STDEV.S for sample: STDEV.S(number1,[number2],...)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of samples reduces, the difference between STDEV.S and STDEV.P increases. The difference between dividing by n-1 or n was developed by Friedrich Bessel to counteract the systematic underestimation of sample variance. By dividing by a smaller number, the calculated value of standard deviation for a sample was increased.If you take many samples from a given population, ideally the standard deviation of the samples would have a mean value equal to that of the standard deviation of the population[8].\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task variance calculation wont be covered but the standard deviation STDDEV.S and STDDEV.P will be covered. Low values of standard deviation tell us that individual values are closer to the mean. High values, on the other hand, tell us that individual observations are far away from the mean of the data."
